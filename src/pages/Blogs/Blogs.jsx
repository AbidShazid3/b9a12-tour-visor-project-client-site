            <p className="p-4">We are on a journey, continuously traveling the world, crossing continents, countries, and regions. While doing so, we have been building a business, living the digital nomad lifestyle, working remotely, and everything in between! Using these experiences, we create detailed travel blogs that are a real and honest account of our travels. Each guide has easy to read information, recommendations, and some beautiful photo inspiration. All of which we hope will give you a flavor of a country, and what it`s like to travel there! <br />

                Use these travel blogs to help you navigate your route, or learn interesting information about your destination. What`s more, our tips & tricks can help you begin the digital nomad journey, help you travel responsibly, or even plastic-free! Whatever it is, Salt in our Hair is a travel blog to find information on travels. Be it a specific continent, country, beach, jungle, or city, it`s all here.</p>
